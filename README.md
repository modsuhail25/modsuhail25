Hi 👋 I'm Suhail

I'm a MERN Stack Developer with hands-on experience building real-world applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
I enjoy turning ideas into products, writing clean code, and continuously improving my problem-solving skills.

Currently focused on:
- Strengthening core JavaScript & DSA
- Building production-ready full-stack applications
- Learning best practices in system design and software architecture

Always curious, always learning 🚀
